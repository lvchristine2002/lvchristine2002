- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christine Li
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in uncovering insights from complex datasets which stemmed from my passion for extracting expresso from coffee beans.
  I would document and analyze my extractions every time I would brew coffee. My undergraduate studies in Data Science at the University of Maryland further fueled my passions,
  through my course major studies and past experiences, I realized the importance of data visualization in decision-making.
  My proficiency in programming languages such as SQL, R, and Python allows me to wrangle and analyze data efficiently.
  Continuous growth is what I strive for in each of my roles whether that is being a student or fulfilling a role at a position, I am always eager to learn new skillsets. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Databricks platform and trying to obtain the Data Analyst Certificate.
